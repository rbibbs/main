* Function that implements Exhaustivity, version 1:
* "Assign a violation for every parent-child pair (x,y) such that x is of PH-level n and y is of PH-level n-m, m >= 2."
* Assigns violations based on distance between categories on PH, but otherwise category-insensitive.
* "Vertically categorical"; greater distance between parent and child on PH does not result in higher vcount.
